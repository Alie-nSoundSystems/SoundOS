Welcome to the Project Page of SoundOS!
---------------------------------------
SoundOS is a lightweight operating system written in C for Arduino IDE.
This project is based on the cheap, but powerful Raspberry Pico W and on an ILI9488 3.5" TFT Touchscreen,
and uses an I2C modul called "MIKROE-4431" to process digitally the audio signal.

Basic features:
 - You can control the DSP via the touchscreen interface (Volume, Bass, Mid, Treble)
 - You can add a fingerprint sensor to ensure the security of your music :-)
 
 - Last, but not least you can activate/deactivate modules on SoundOS depending on your needs
 
Modules:
 - Lockscreen module
 - Weather forecast module
 - DSP module

Specifications:
 - Based on the Raspberry Pico W board
