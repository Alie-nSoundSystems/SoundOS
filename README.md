Welcome to the Project Page of SoundOS!
---------------------------------------
SoundOS is a lightweight operating system written in C for Arduino IDE.
This project is based on the cheap, but powerful Raspberry Pico W and on an ILI9488 3.5" TFT Touchscreen,
and uses an I2C modul called "MIKROE-4431" to process digitally the audio signal.

Basic features:
 - You can control the DSP via the touchscreen interface (Volume, Bass, Mid, Treble)
 - You can add a fingerprint sensor to ensure the security of your music :-)
 - Based on Bodmer's OpenWeather and TFT_eSPI library (Lots of thanks to Bodmer!)
 - Last, but not least you can activate/deactivate modules on SoundOS depending on your needs
 
Modules:
 - Lockscreen module
 - Weather forecast module
 - DSP module
 - Background module (Image can be replaced, but can't be deactivated, must be the resolution of 480x320)
 
Specifications:
 - Based on the Raspberry Pico W board
 - 
 
Versions:
 - Beta 0.0.1: Added Background & Lockscreen module
